### IDE Features
![IDE](ide_features.png)

## Using

First, you will need to install Visual Studio Code `0.10` or newer. In the command pallete (`cmd-shift-p`) select `Install Extension` and choose `RustyCode`.

Then, you need to install Racer (instructions and source code [here](https://github.com/phildawes/racer)).

Also, you need to install Rustfmt (instructions and source code [here](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt))

And last step is downloading Rust language source files from [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

### Options

The following Visual Studio Code settings are available for the RustyCode extension. These can be set in user preferences or workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)

```javascript
{
	"rust.racerPath": null, // Specifies path to Racer binary if it's not in PATH
	"rust.rustLangSrcPath": null, // Specifies path to /src directory of local copy of Rust sources
	"rust.rustfmtPath": null, // Specifies path to Rustfmt binary if it's not in PATH
	"rust.formatOnSave": false, // Turn on/off autoformatting file on save (EXPERIMENTAL)
}
```

## Building and Debuggind the Extension

[Repository](https://github.com/saviorisdead/RustyCode)

You can set up a development enviroment for debugging the extension during extension development.

First make sure you do not have the extension installed in `~/.vscode/extensions`. Then clone the repo somewhere else on your machine, run `npm install` and open a development instance of Code.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.vscode/extensions/RustyCode
cd ~
git clone https:://github.com/saviorisdead/RustyCode
cd RustyCode
npm install
npm run-script compile
code .
```

You can now go to the Debug viewlet and select `Launch Extension` then hit run (`F5`).
If you make edits in the extension `.ts` files, just reload (`cmd-r`) the `[Extension Development Host]` instance of Code to load in the new extension code.  The debugging instance will automatically reattach.
